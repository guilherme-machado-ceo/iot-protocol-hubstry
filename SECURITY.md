# Security Policy

## üîí Harmonic IoT Protocol Security

The Harmonic IoT Protocol incorporates security as a fundamental design principle, leveraging the mathematical properties of harmonic frequencies to create inherently secure communication channels.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Harmonic Signature Authentication
- **Unique Device Fingerprints**: Each device uses a specific combination of harmonic frequencies as its signature
- **Spectral Identity Verification**: Authentication based on harmonic patterns rather than traditional keys
- **Anti-Spoofing Protection**: Difficult to replicate harmonic signatures without deep protocol knowledge

### Spectral Cryptography
- **Frequency-Domain Encryption**: Information encoded in the selection and modulation of harmonic frequencies
- **Multi-Layer Security**: Data payload encryption combined with spectral pattern obfuscation
- **Dynamic Channel Allocation**: Changing harmonic assignments to prevent eavesdropping

### Intrusion Detection
- **Spectral Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of the frequency spectrum for unauthorized activity
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual harmonic patterns or interference
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notification of potential security breaches

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No              |
