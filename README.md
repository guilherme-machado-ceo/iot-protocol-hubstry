# Harmonic IoT Protocol

An innovative communication protocol for IoT and embedded systems based on the mathematical principles of the musical harmonic series.

## 🎵 Project Overview

The **Harmonic IoT Protocol** uses harmonic frequencies as literal information carriers, where each harmonic subdivision (H1, H2, ..., Hn) receives a unique identifier and is mapped to specific system functions like sensors, actuators, control, or security. This enables multichannel and omnichannel communication, integrating different interfaces such as BLE, LoRa, and Wi-Fi.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Mathematical Robustness**: Predictable, interference-resistant communication channels
- **Enhanced Security**: Harmonic signatures and spectral cryptography
- **Infinite Scalability**: New devices can be added by assigning them to new harmonic channels
- **Omnichannel Integration**: Unifies BLE, LoRa, Wi-Fi, and other communication technologies
- **Native Efficiency**: Optimized for digital signal processing and Fourier analysis

## 🔧 Core Concepts

- **Musical Harmonic Series**: Creates unique and predictable communication channels
- **Fundamental Frequency (f₀)**: Establishes the system's base frequency
- **Harmonic Subdivisions**: Multiples of f₀ (2f₀, 3f₀, etc.) function as specific channels
- **Harmonic Multiplexing**: Enables simultaneous communication across multiple harmonics
- **Harmonic Omnichannel**: Integrates different communication interfaces through harmonic modulation
